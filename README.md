# Certifiable (v1.4 January 21, 2025)

Certifiable is a free open source command line program for Windows which generates code to assign a SSL Certificate PEM to a variable.

The following languages are supported for code generation: C++, Python, and VB.net.  If you would like another programming language added, please just open an issue including an example of what a statement would look like in that language.

## Download 

You are welcome to download and use Certifiable on as many computers as you would like.

A downloadable signed executable portable copy of the program for Windows (x64) is available from [here](https://github.com/roblatour/certifiable/releases/download/v1.4.0.0/certifiable.exe).

## Example output

From the Windows command line:

## Using Certifiable

From the command prompt just type "certifiable ?" (without the quotes) to see the help as mostly reproduced below:<br>

certifiable [ host (-p n) (-d) (-n n) (-g x) (-v x) (-c) (-w) (-o) (-f) ] | [ ] | [ ? ]<br>

host&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the host name or IP address from which to get the certificate(s)<br>
       for example: google.com, www.google.com, 142.251.41.14<br>
       a host value is required in all cases other than displaying this help information<br>

Options:<br>

 -p n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the host's port number<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for example: -p 8096<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if not used a port number of 443 will be assumed<br>

 -d &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; display the host's certificate(s) with unique number for each<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if neither -c or -o options are used, the -d option will be assumed<br>

 -f &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;by default future dated certificates are excluded<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if -f is used, then future dated certificates will be included<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;note: expired certificates are always excluded<br>

 -n n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;in many cases a host will have multiple certificates<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-n indicates a specific certificate should be used for code generation, the second n specifies which one<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for example, -n 3<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;indicates only the 3rd certificate should be used for code generation<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if not used, code for all certificates will be generation<br>

 -g x &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; used to specifying the language in which the code will be generated<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;supported languages are: c++, python, and vb.net<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for example: -g vb.net<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally, c++ may be followed by the option progmem<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if c++ is followed by progmem the generated code will store the certificate in program memory<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(flash memory) rather than in RAM (SRAM)<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for example: -g c++ progmem<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if not used, the c++ will be assumed<br>

 -v x &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the variable name to be used in the output file<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for example: -v server_root_cert<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if not used, a variable name based on the host name / IP address will be generated<br>

 -c &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; the generated code will be copied to the clipboard<br>

 -w x &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the generated code will be written to the specified (path and) file name<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for example, -w c:\temp\certificate.h<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the output path name is optional, if omitted the output file will be written to the current working directory<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for example, -w certificate.h<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if the path is specified but does not exist, it will be created<br>

 -o &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; if the -w option is used and the specified file already exists<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the user will be prompted to overwrite the file unless the -o options is used<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;in which case the existing file will be automatically overwritten<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for example, -w c:\temp\certificate.h -o<br>

 Certifiable used with no arguments, or with '?' displays this help<br>

Final notes on usage:<br>
&nbsp; the -d option does not generate code, rather simply displays available information<br>
&nbsp; code will only be generated if the -c or -w options are used<br>
